# Merge post data with comments array using JSONPlaceholder API
This simple application allows the user to fetch the post with ID 50, and retrieve all the comments associated with it and merge the array of comments into the post data using a "comments" key.

The merged array is then displayed on the page and also logged on the console.

## Deployment and installation

To run this project, just clone the repository and open the webpage.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mkahara/merge-post-data-with-comments-using-jsonplaceholder-api.git
```

## Usage

After opening the webpage, click the `Get Post` button. This triggers the `mergePostWithComments` JavaScript function which fetches the post data from the JSONPlaceholder API.

On clicking the button, the function will display the post data and its comments from the merged data. I used a simple html table to display the comments in a cleaner way.

The merged array is also displayed on the page and also logged on the console.
